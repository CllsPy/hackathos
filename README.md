# Hackathos

Documenting my hackathon projects, Kaggle competitions, and experiments — including wins, baselines, and approaches I tried along the way.

These projects reflect my participation in data challenges, from classic Kaggle problems (Titanic, Disaster Tweets) to domain-specific datasets (earthquake damage, steel plate defects, loan approvals, etc.).


## Repository Structure

Each project lives in its own folder with the following structure:

```
project-name/
│
├── data/             # Data (links, preprocessing scripts, or small sample if allowed)
├── notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks with EDA, models, and experiments
├── src/              # Core Python scripts (training, inference, utilities)
├── results/          # Metrics, plots, and outputs
└── README.md         # Project-specific description
```

Example:

├── notebooks/

├── src/

└── README.md

## Projects Included

* 2024 Loan Approval – ML models for predicting loan eligibility.
* 2024 Regression with a Flood Prediction Dataset – Time-series/regression for flood impact prediction.
* 2024 Regression with an Abalone Dataset – Predicting abalone age from physical measurements.
* 2024 Santa: Perplexity Permutation Puzzle – Kaggle seasonal puzzle competition.
* Disaster Tweets – Classifying tweets as real or not about disasters.
* Predicting Earthquake Damage – Severity prediction for buildings after an earthquake.
* Steel Plate Defect – Detecting types of steel defects.
* Titanic Competition – The classic ML starter challenge.

## Goals

* Practice end-to-end ML pipelines: EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation.
* Apply different algorithms (linear models, trees, ensembles, neural nets).
* Document lessons learned from each competition.
